# Notes about my site

## Requirements

 - Pelican: `pip install pelican`
 - beautifulsoup4: `pip install beautifulsoup4`

## Theme

All theme-related files (CSS, etc.) are in `theme/`.

### CSS & less

This site uses the terrific [less](http://lesscss.org/) CSS pre-processor to
create the CSS. All less files are in `__less/` and are compiled into CSS files
with `Makefile`. Install less and less-plugin-clean-css

    npm install -g less
    npm install -g less-plugin-clean-css


## .com to .org redirect

This is accomplished with an `.htaccess` file:

    Options +FollowSymlinks
    RewriteEngine on
    rewritecond %{http_host} ^vincebuffalo.com [nc]
    rewriterule ^(.*)$ http://vincebuffalo.org/$1 [r=301,nc]

## Markdown Style

### Code Blocks

Indicate the language (so [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) can highlight
it) with the code format:

    ```{python
        def is_dead(animal):
            return animal.alive

        is_dead(parrot)
    ```

### Block Quote

Use the standard Markdown blockquote format, but add `<small></small>` for the
attribution:

    > Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague,
    > than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.
    > <small>John Tukey, 1962</small>

    
### pre/code styling

`<pre></pre>` blocks are temperamental about newlines; this can affect
styling. Newlines are interpreted, so in some cases code should be formatted as:

    <pre><code class="python">def simulate_coalescent(theta, n):
    # stuff
    return sim</code></pre>

### Asides

Inspired by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)'s terrific books,
I wanted asides in my pages. Stylistically, these should be aligned with their
callout (e.g. an asterisk), but this is rather difficult as HTML5's
`<aside></aside>` will break a paragraph. To maintain consistent styling, place
`<aside></aside>` after the callout. There isn't a markdown aside, so use the
`<aside></aside>` tags directly.
