# The Beauty of Bioconductor

With respect to software, I try not to throw around the word "beauty"
too often. Beauty is subjective: hand a Perl programmer a well-crafted
Lisp s-expression that illustrates the power of meta-programming and
they'll proclaim it's hideous because of all those parentheses. 

## Where is Bioinformatics?

current model: download files, run stuff on them

### Statistics at every level

## Massive Power

It's an interesting time in high performance computing. On one hand,
developers still jump to "older" languages like C and Fortran when we
need something done quickly. On the other hand, there's new lots of
new technology in compilers (LLVM, JIT, etc) and distributed computing
(Hadoop). However, many languages still push matrix operations to BLAS
and LAPACK and implement core algorithms and data structures in C. If
some operation can be done in C faster than a scripting language, it's
usually a matter of time before someone writes an C implementation and
wraps it in their favorite scripting language.
