# Why static blogging?

## Simplicity

I spend hours each week in Emacs, and I've spent [ages customizing
it](http://github.com/vsbuffalo/.emacs.d). With
[Jekll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll),
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and
[Blueprint](http://blueprintcss.org) I quickly built this site in my
favorite editor. I can spend time writing content, not fighting a
browser WYSIWYG editor.

## Mentality

Also, I want this site to function as a notebook. Most blogging
systems lead to a post-and-forget mentality. Revision control makes,
well, revisions easier.

## Plaintext

Plaintext is powerful (see [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) if you
don't believe me). If I want to search all my posts using regular
expressions, I can with `grep`. How could this be done if I was using
WordPress or any blogging system that used database backend?
