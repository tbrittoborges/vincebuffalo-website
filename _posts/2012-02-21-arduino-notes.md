# Arduino Notes

The following are some notes/links I've come across when working with
my Arduino Uno.

## Arduino Development

Ultimately I want to develop through Emacs, not the Arduino IDE. Doing
this well involves (1) a good mode for Emacs, (2) interfacing with
avr-gcc, and (3) a makefile or script that uploads the binary to the
Arduino.
