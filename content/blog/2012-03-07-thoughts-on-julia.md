Title: Thoughts on Julia and R

## Hello, Julia

[Julia](http://julialang.org) is an exciting new technical computing
language. It's still in its infancy, but it's fast (see below), and
already does a lot.

There's been some excitement on Twitter about Julia. Excitement
combined with open source often yields development, which then leads
to further excitement, until a mature open source project arises. One
of Julia's explicit goals is to challenge other statistical computing
environments, including R.

## What's wrong with R?

R is, without a doubt, changing the world. It's being used by industry
giants like Facebook and Google, while also providing academic
researchers in statistics, biology, psychology, and countless other
fields with not only a free and open source statistical environment,
but a huge number of user-contributed package through CRAN. Now
methods papers in many fields are often accompanied by CRAN or
Bioconductor packages. It's also a brilliant platform for reproducible,
open research, as Bioconductor beautifully illustrates with packaged
and version-controlled genomes, microarray probesets, etc.

However, R is suffering from growing pains. For example, there are now
64-bit versions of R, however, vector indexing is still limited by
`R_len_t` (see definition in `src/include/Rinternals.h`):

```R
/* type for length of vectors etc */
typedef int R_len_t; /* will be long later, LONG64 or ssize_t on Win64 */
#define R_LEN_T_MAX INT_MAX
```

It appears that one can simply change this to a long and recompile to
increase the longest possible addressable vector, but no. Take a look
at `R_euclidean` in `library/stats/src/distance.c` for an example why:
almost all variables for iterating over elements in vectors are
defined as integers and don't use this type. One would have to read
through every function, and every line of code to fix this.

`R_len_t` is just one example. Another issue is that R has been slow
to adopt new compiler technologies (i.e. JIT, optional type
indications, etc). R almost always gains speed from pushing stuff to C
(the recent bytecode compiler is an exception). This isn't a problem,
but it's a huge limitation to require developers to not only know R,
but also C, and also how to interface the two. More modern languages
(Java, as well as Python and Julia come to mind) spend more time
tracking compiler technology developments and implementing them than R
core does (again, Luke Tierney and the bytecode compiler are
exceptions). It's still sometimes efficient to use C with these
languages (consider [Cython](http://cython.org/)), but developers in
these language aren't cracking open Kernighan and Ritchie everytime
they need to have a `for` loop do something quickly.

Another gripe I have is that R language development is somewhat
closed. Despite a quickly expanding user base, the number of R core
contributors is not increasing. I find it hard to believe this is due
to lack of interest. It seems much more likely this is due to
institutional reasons that need to be changed. The nice thing about
language development that it's really hard, so opening up R to more
contributors won't likely flood the existing core with bad ideas and
patches. Personally I would dedicate much more time profiling, reading
the source, and working on the R language if it were more open.

The last gripe I have is that R is fragmented. Consider Python:

```Python
import re
re.search(r'R-([\d]+).([\d]+)', "R-2.15").groups()
```

   
Now, consider R:
  
```R
gsub("R-([\\d]+)\\.([\\d]+)", "\\1", "R-2.15")

# or

library(stringr)
str_match("R-2.15", "R-([0-9]+)\\.([0-9]+)")
```
    
Now, Python also has PyPI's [`re2`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/re2/),
but most developers are using `re`. The motivation behind `stringr` is
that R's currently family of string processing functions are horribly
inconsistent:

```R
# (my ... to avoid writing all parameters)
grep(pattern, x, ...)
regexpr(pattern, text, ...)
gsub(pattern, replacement, x, ...)
strsplit(x, split, ...)
```
    
But rather than deprecate these and move forward, we now have *two*
sets of string processing
functions. [Both are being used](http://github.com/search?langOverride=&language=R&q=str_extract&repo=&start_value=1&type=Code). I'm
not saying Hadley Wickham is to blame here; quite the contrary, he's
trying to fix a very annoying problem in the language and should be
commended. I think the community needs to be more open; for example,
before writing a package that processes strings, let's discuss an
implementation plan, deprecating old functions, etc. If not, in the
future R will be highly fragmented, and end up with five different
object orientation systems... oh, wait.

## What would it take to "challenge" R?

Contributors to Julia are optimistic they can challenge R based on a
solid foundation of JIT compiling, parallelism, and nice language
semantics. I salute this optimism, but I think we need to
realistically consider what it would take to "challenge" R. 

First, we would need to build an equal statistical computing
environment. Consider moving all of `stats`, `MASS`, `graphics`,
`grid`, etc to Julia. Is Julia sufficiently faster than R *will be* in
the time it takes to port these base packages? Remember, R is a moving
target; despite my few earlier gripes, R will evolve and get
faster. Now, consider adding the extremely popular CRAN packages like
`ggplot2` and `lattice` to Julia. In the time it takes to port these,
is Julia still sufficiently faster than R will be?

Suppose it is still faster than R. What about after we port the rest
of CRAN, and all of Bioconductor to Julia? My point isn't say that
it's unimaginable that Julia will surpass R. It's that developers
should really dissect what makes a successful language successful
before they try to challenge it. I don't have a horse in this race; I
would love to see Julia surpass R. But if all developers want is a
fast environment to analyze large data sets using a wealth of methods
and libraries, it may be a lot easier to make R faster than to develop
a new fast language and hope/wait/beg the community to move over.

**Update:** Julia core developer Jeff Bezanson sent me a very kind
  email on March 9th, 20012 about this post. In it, he said the
  "challenge R" statement was made by a community member and is in no
  way the mission of the Julia language. He had many kind words to say
  about the R langauge and its statistical functionality.
