           <h2>X Chromosome Genealogies</h2>

               One simulation of an X-genealogy 10 generations back. Gray
               indicates genealogical ancestors that are not X ancestors, blue
               indicates male ancestors, red indicates female ancestors, and
               white indicates genealogical X ancestors that do not share
               genetic material with the present day individual. The
               transparency of the red and blue arcs is proportional to the
               genetic material shared that X ancestor and the present-day
               individual.

             During summer 2015, Graham, <a
               href="http://www.clfs.umd.edu/labs/mount/">Steve Mount</a>, and
             I worked out a set of probability distributions that model the
             number of blocks and their lengths one shares with an <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome">X
               chromosome</a> ancestor $k$ generations back in the past.
             Additionally, we modelled the number and lengths blocks one shares
             with a present-day relative on the X chromosome. As ancestry
             services like <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andme</a> and
             <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/">ancestry.com</a> use identical
             by descent blocks<sup>1</sup> between individuals to infer shared
             ancestry, Graham and I were curious how much information about
             ancestry is in X chromosomes and what these block distributions
             look like.  </p> <aside><sup>1</sup>A stretch of DNA that that
             derived from a common ancestor without being broken by
             recombination or changed via mutation is <strong>identical by
               descent</strong>. For more technical details on identity by
             descent, see <a

           <p>Since the heterogametic sex only has <em>one</em> X ancestor
             (e.g. in humans, males have only one X ancestor in the previous
             generation — their mother), one's number of X ancestors $k$
             generations back is curiously enough the $(k+2)^\text{th}$ <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci
               number</a>. Additionally, X chromosomes only undergo meiotic
             recombination in females, so the distribution of recombinational
             meioses varies depending on the lineage to a particular ancestor.
             This leads to some neat combinatorics that we use in our
             derivation of our distributions.</p>

           <p>Graham, Steven, and I have written up this manuscript, and a
             preprint is now available <a

           <h2>Demographic and Geographic Summaries of Pairwise Coalescent Time Distributions</h2>

            Preliminary versions of this method (top figure), show that my
            low-rank approximations of older coalescent times (as captured by
            short shared genomic regions) capture older European population
            history, while low-rank approximations (bottom figure) of more
            recent coalescent times (very long shared genomic regions) capture
            more recent history between individuals from Albania and Kosovo.

               Fellowship application (funded).</em>

           <p>
             Most species live in spatially structured populations, connected
             through a complex demographic history of population movements and
             splits, migrations, expansions, and declines. The demography of
             populations both reflects and impacts processes on evolutionary
             time scales (e.g. speciation, local adaptation, gene flow) and
             ecological timescales (e.g. competition, disease spread,
             predation). Population genomic methods (Novembre et al., 2008; Li
             and Durbin, 2011) seek to infer these demographic and
             geographic histories.
           </p>

           <p>
             
             However, I see current methods as having two limitations: (1) they
             are unable to reconstruct recent demographic and migratory events
             over the past tens to hundreds of generations, and (2) these
             methods are not well positioned to utilize the hundreds to
             thousands of individuals currently being sequenced and genotyped. 
           </p>

           <p>

            Graham and I are currently looking into how to tackle this problem
            by summarizing pairwise coalescent time distributions across each
            pair in a sample, and then summarizing these coalescent times
            across various time slices (e.g. 0-10, 11-30 generations, etc).
            Over all pairs of individuals we obtain a matrix of the number of
            shared common ancestors for each time period, which captures
            individuals’ relatedness in particular time slices. However, each
            matrix is likely to be sparse (contain many zero entries), due to
            noise in coalescent time estimation — which we're tackling with
            statistical approaches that smooth across adjacent time slices and
            across individuals.</p>
