              During my time as a bioinformatician at the UC Davis Genome Center
              and in the Dubcovsky and Ross-Ibarra labs, I found very few books
              taught the data skills I relied on most in my day-to-day
              bioinformatics work. Furthermore, texts didn't emphasize scientific
              computing best practices alongside teaching technical skills.

              <em>Bioinformatics Data Skills</em> (published by O'Reilly Media in
              July 2015) is my book that seeks to fill this role. </p>

                Most existing bioinformatics texts focus on algorithms and
                theories. Bioinformatics Data Skills takes a refreshingly practical
                approach by providing a comprehensive introduction to the
                techniques, tools, and best practices that foster reproducible
                research in genome informatics. Its hands on approach is perfect
                for graduate students, postdocs, professors, and hobbyists alike.
