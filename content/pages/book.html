              During my time as a bioinformatician at the UC Davis Genome Center
              and in the Dubcovsky and Ross-Ibarra labs, I found very few books
              taught the data skills I relied on most in my day-to-day
              bioinformatics work. Furthermore, texts didn't emphasize scientific
              computing best practices alongside teaching technical skills.

              <em>Bioinformatics Data Skills</em> (published by O'Reilly Media in
              July 2015) is my book that seeks to fill this role. </p>

I wish this book was available two years ago when I first started my graduate studies - It literally could have saved me a year.

            <blockquote class="tiny-blockquote"> <p> Superb book for those
looking to develop bioinformatics skills. Covers loads of the supporting skills
that are generally learnt through years of experience and aren't obvious in
other texts/courses.<br/>

                Should be required reading for any PhD students or lab scientist working with data.

I have been programming in a UNIX environment for 26 years, and a leader in
bioinformatics since I entered the field in 1998, and was surprised to find
that I was able to learn useful tips and tricks in nearly every chapter.

<h3>Audience</h3> 
            <p> <em>Bioinformatics Data Skills</em> is an
intermediate-level book, aimed at readers with some experience with a scripting
language like Python, and very basic Unix (e.g. the Unix filesystem hierarchy,
<code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, etc.). <em>Bioinformatics Data Skills</em>
gives readers a solid Unix foundation in chapters 3 ("Remedial Unix Shell"), 7
("Unix Data Tools"), and 12 ("Bioinformatics Shell Scripting", "Writing
Pipelines", and "Parallelizing Tasks"). Readers are also introduced to the R
language through learning exploratory data analysis (chapter 8).

            </p>

              <h3>Supporting Materials</h3>
            <p>

              <em>Bioinformatics Data Skills</em> has over 700 code examples
for readers to follow along with. All supporting data and scripts (as well
tips, annecdotes, and extended footnotes) are available in my book's Github
repository at <a
href="http://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/">http://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/</a>.
            </p>
